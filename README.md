Optimal Design of "Shewhart-Type" Control Charts under a "Single" Assignable Cause and "Various" Control Statistics, Process Failure Mechanisms, and Sampling Schemes

This code is capable to be used for the economic and economic statistical design of Shewhart-type control charts with/under:
- a single assignable cause,
- univariate and multivariate control statistics (e.g., Xbar and T2 Hotelling),
- normal and non-normal quality data in univariate cases,
- different hazard rates (costant, decreasing, increasing, bathtub, etc.),
- various process failure mechanisms or shock models (e.g., exponential, Weibull and Chen distributions), and
- various sampling schemes including uniform scheme and non-uniform with constant integrated hazard.
